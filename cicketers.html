<h2 onclick="sachin()"> Sachin Tendulaker</h2>
<div id="sach">Sachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement,
    precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox
    shots (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull them out at will.</div>




<h2 onclick="dhoni()"> M.S Dhoni
</h2>
<div id="dhoni">Mahendra Singh Dhoni (listen); born 7 July 1981) is an Indian professional cricketer who was captain of the Indian national cricket team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is a right-handed wicket-keeper
